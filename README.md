This repository will be having my academic projects.


AirTravels
 


Project Description: 
This programming project involves developing a Airline Reservation System for use by travel professionals (i.e. not passengers). It should be a Java-based GUI application that interfaces with a backend MySQL database to manage its data. GUI may be either a native application or browser-based (e.g JSP, ASP).

This project is spring based web application, which uses JQuery, AJAX & JSON to pass the data from the Web UI. The data is received by spring controllers, which are passed to the DAO classes that handle the Database operations. I have used simple SQL queries to fetch the data, which are mapped to DTO classes using RowMapper util classes. The data received from the Database is sent to Web UI in JSON format, which are interpreted by JQuery to populated in tables using JQuery datatables plugin.


MyDatabase


Project Description: The goal of this project is to implement a program that parses an ASCII text-based CSV data file and then transforms that same information to a memory-efficient format and writes it to a binary data file. The new binary data file shall also have multiple index files for efficient record retrieval of values from fields other than the primary key. 

Pls find the detailed project information in the associated project details document

Semantic Web Project

Web application to provide a graphical presentation of statistics related to the veteran health management for the year 2008. 
Data in the form of RDF(Resource Description Format) triples, has been downloaded from the site http://data-gov.tw.rpi.edu/ and uploaded to apache fuseki server.
Web application queries the fuseki server using AJAX and populates the data in the screen using Google graphs API.
Web application is built using angular.js and node.js and bootstrap css.
Note: node.js is used only for page navigation, as the application is front-end specific and doesnt require much more.

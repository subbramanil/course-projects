This repository will be having my academic projects.


1. AirTravels
Project Description: 
This programming project involves developing a Airline Reservation System for use by travel professionals (i.e. not passengers). It should be a Java-based GUI application that interfaces with a backend MySQL database to manage its data1. GUI may be either a native application or browser-based (e.g JSP, ASP).

This project is spring based web application, which uses JQuery, AJAX & JSON to pass the data from the Web UI. The data is received by spring controllers, which are passed to the DAO classes that handle the Database operations. I have used simple SQL queries to fetch the data, which are mapped to DTO classes using RowMapper util classes. The data received from the Database is sent to Web UI in JSON format, which are interpreted by JQuery to populated in tables using JQuery datatables plugin.

2. MyDatabase
Project Description:The goal of this project is to implement a program that parses an ASCII text-based CSV data file and then transforms that same information to a memory-efficient format and writes it to a binary data file. The new binary data file shall also have multiple index files for efficient record retrieval of values from fields other than the primary key.
3. Semantic Web Project

Overview:
The goal of this project is to implement a program that parses an ASCII text-based CSV data file and then transforms that same information to a memory-efficient format and writes it to a binary data file. The new binary data file shall also have multiple index files for efficient record retrieval of values from fields other than the primary key. Your program should operate entirely from the command line (no GUI).
